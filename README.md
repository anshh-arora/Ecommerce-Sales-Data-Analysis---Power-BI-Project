## **About the Files**

The project uses two primary data files: `orders.csv` and `details.csv`.

   - `Profit`: Profit earned from the item
   - `Quantity`: Number of units sold
   - `Category`: The main category of the product
   - `Sub-Category`: Subcategory under the main category
   - `PaymentMode`: Mode of payment used for the transaction (e.g., COD, EMI)

   **Example data**:
   | Order ID | Amount | Profit | Quantity | Category    | Sub-Category    | PaymentMode |

   - `Order ID`: Unique identifier for each order
   - `Order Date`: Date when the order was placed
   - `CustomerName`: Name of the customer who placed the order
   - `State`: State where the order was delivered
